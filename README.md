REQUIRES THAT THE USER HAS INSTALLED DOSBox VERSION 0.76 ON HIS/HER PC -available on www.dosbox.com


DOSRocket is a graphical user interface for the popular DOSBox environment, which allows you to manage and run MS-DOS programs without memorizing those tedious DOSBox commands. Just add your program, link the 
executable (.EXE) file to it, and decorate it with some album art. DOSRocket will automatically open up your program in DOSBox, with your preferences (fullscreen blah blah etc etc.)

DOSRocket was made for my school examinations project, hence it uses Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) and MySQL. Please ensure that you have MySQL server installed on your PC, with username and password both set as "root".  

DOSRocket utilizes the MySQL JDBC Driver and the Apache Exec API.

I support open source, but I can't release any code right now to prevent cloning by (lazy) classmates. I'll put the complete source code up for grabs once I'm done with school life (March 2015 or later, depending on calamity striking our practical examinations :p )
